= How does it work? =

Essert software is a SaaS product. And, we provide this Wordpress plugin for easy deployment.

Step 1 is to sign-up on app.essert.io, and onboard (by selecting one of the free or paid compliance worklists).

Step 2 is to sign-in from the Wordpress plugin and get the secret code.

Step 3 is to publish the privacy intake forms and/or buttons using shortcodes in the request forms tab.

Step 4 is to publish all public policy notices or disclosures intake forms on your website, using shortcodes in the policies tab.

Step 5 is to test one of the forms to ensure that you receive the requests on the app.essert.io

= Our website is managed by an external agency, what should they do? =

You have two options. Option 1 is to add your agency as a partner user. Option 2 is to email the two (2) forms to them and give them instructions to deploy the forms on your website. You or your agency may customize the forms as you see fit.

= Are the intake forms customizable? =

Yes. You may customize the intake forms. On app.essert.io, we provide HTML files for privacy intake. Anyone of your team members or your agency team with knowledge of HTML can easily customize these intake forms.

= Do you provide privacy policy templates for use? =

Yes. While we do not provide any legal advice, we provide a privacy policy template, and several other policy templates including website terms of use, social media policy and more. Our privacy policy template was authored by a privacy attorney and is provided to you as is. We do recommend that you consult an attorney, or call us to get our suggestions for changes. You may publish this privacy policy template using shortcodes. You may edit and customize the privacy policy template using app.essert.io and maintain a auditable record of any changes.
